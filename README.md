# Paper-Airplane-Experiment

### Project Objective

The goal of this experiment is to determine if the design of the paper airplane, type of paper
and payload of the plane impact the total flight distance of the paper airplane.

### Factors Examined

- Plane Type: Basic Dart, Stable
- Paper Type: A4, Construction
- Payload: No Load, Load (load in the form of two binder paper clips)

### Methodology

- Literature review

- Experimental design

- Data analysis

- Data snopping

### Key Findings and Conclusion

At family wise confidence interval of 95%:

- There was a significant difference between the mean flight distance of Basic Dart and Stable for both
levels of Paper Type.

- There was a significant difference between the mean flight distance of Basic Dart and Stable for both
levels of Payload.

- There was no significant difference in the means of No Load and Load when the Paper Type was
fixed as A4.

- There was a significant difference in the means of No Load and Load when the Paper Type was fixed
as Construction.
